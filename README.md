## Tips for potential contributors

Make a fork, clone the repo, open in favorite code editor, and you are ready for development! Sounds easy, huh?
I left out all necessary firebase configurations open for public, so feel free to use them for dev purposes only!
Here some scripts for you:

### `npm install`

Installs all necessary packages to boot up the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
